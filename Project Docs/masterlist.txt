Todo
- Implement visual UI instead of text and numbers
- Power Management System
- Prevent Enemy collision with more directed movement
- Continue to refactor game.js to not be so dense
- If enemy reaches ship, kamikaze attack for double dmg
- fix mothership hitbox to ignore edge cases

Issues
- Flickering sprites for both enemy and ship
- Am I even using fontawesome in this project or is it just there...? (its used for html icons)

Current Changes
- mute button now works and has feedback
- Font loading problem
  - tried to use fontfaceset loading but doesn't work.
  - 3 different methods failed: fontfaceset onload, the css and hidden div
  - Wait a second, how does the TITLE FONT work but the canvas font doesn't?
  - Using tiny timeout as a temp solution as it looks hella bad without it
- Made shield disappear after losing all HP
- starting npm refactor (discarded unstable build)
- use explosion as model for conversion, now all stable
- completed bullets, player, enemyship, parallaxbg
- completed shooting cd addition
- main task for today: separate enemy update from draw
- the above didn't fix problem, need to change enemy attack method in game.
- fixed simultaneous shooting enemies by adding custom cd for each enemy
  -upon invoking update, it will either reduce cd or shoot if cd is up
