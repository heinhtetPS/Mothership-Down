Todo
- Implement visual UI instead of text and numbers
- Power Management System
- Prevent Enemy collision with more directed movement
- Continue to refactor game.js to not be so dense
- If enemy reaches ship, kamikaze attack for double dmg

Issues
- Flickering sprites for both enemy and ship
- Am I even using fontawesome in this project or is it just there...? (its used for html icons)
- Cannon doesn't die properly.
  - deathtimer only counts to 10 and .alive is only false for milliseconds. Cannon dies but respawns without permission.
  - this problem above has resolved itself mysteriously overnight

Current Changes
- mute button now works and has feedback
- Font loading problem
  - tried to use fontfaceset loading but doesn't work.
  - 3 different methods failed: fontfaceset onload, the css and hidden div
  - Wait a second, how does the TITLE FONT work but the canvas font doesn't?
  - Using tiny timeout as a temp solution as it looks hella bad without it
- Made shield disappear after losing all HP
- starting npm refactor (discarded unstable build)
- use explosion as model for conversion, now all stable
- completed bullets, player, enemyship, parallaxbg
- completed shooting cd addition
