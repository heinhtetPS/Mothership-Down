Todo
- Implement visual UI instead of text and numbers
- Power Management System
- Prevent Enemy collision with more directed movement
- Of course, refactor code to not be one huge blob
- shooting needs cooldown or some sort of restriction


Issues
- Flickering sprites for both enemy and ship
- Am I even using fontawesome in this project or is it just there...? (its used for html icons)
- Cannon doesn't die properly.


Current Changes
- mute button now works and has feedback
- Font loading problem
  - tried to use fontfaceset loading but doesn't work.
  - 3 different methods failed: fontfaceset onload, the css and hidden div
  - Wait a second, how does the TITLE FONT work but the canvas font doesn't?
  - Using tiny timeout as a temp solution as it looks hella bad without it
- refactoring playershoot to 1) be connected to cannon and 2) have more reasonable cd
- Made shield disappear after losing all HP
- starting npm refactor (discarded unstable build)
- use explosion as model for conversion, now all stable. Have to convert bullets;
- completed bullets conversion to class and seperation from main
