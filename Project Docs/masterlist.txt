Todo
- Implement visual UI instea of text and numbers
- Power Management System
- Prevent Enemy collision with more directed movement
- Of course, refactor code to not be one huge blob
- shooting needs cooldown or some sort of restriiction


Issues
- Font and images need to load before first screen
- Only show shield if it has HP
- Flickering sprites for both enemy and ship
- Am I even using fontawesome in this project or is it just there...?


Current Changes
- mute button now works and has feedback
- tried to use fontfaceset loading but doesn't work.
- 3 different methods failed: fontfaceset onload, the css and hidden div
- Wait a second, how does the TITLE FONT work but the canvas font doesn't?
